# ATL Gardens Webpage

The final project for CS4400 Intro to Database Systems. We were tasked with creating a ER diagram for the relational database
tables, writing the SQL queries, and building a full stack app. The project tasked us with creating a propetry management
portal for owners and visitors of Atlanta area gardens, farms, and orchards.

My major contribution to the project was implementing a backend server that would link the webpage portal to the MySQL database
containing all the data. I created/wrote the app using ExpressJS/NodeJS with local hosting/. While the whole team worked on writing
the SQL queries together, I worked on making sure they worked and formatted them in an ExpressJS friendly format. Using ExpressJS
I exposed an HTTP RESTful API so that the team memebers working on the webpage could send user input and recieve query responses.
